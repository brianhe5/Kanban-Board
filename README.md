**Kanban Board**

**Features**
- Implement a website that acts as a task tracker, with three columns (“To-Do”, “In Progress”, “Done”) storing task cards with a color, title, and description that can be moved from one column to another, edited, and deleted
- Add a local storage feature to enable data to persist even after the site is refreshed or closed
- Enabled users to drag and drop a text file on a card which edits the card description to contain the text file contents
- Create a light and dark mode for the site that users can toggle on click
